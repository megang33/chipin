# ChipIn

ChipIn is a web application to connect organizations with volunteers for local events. It provides a space for organizations to interface directly with volunteers and create and promote their events. ChipIn encourages peer-to-peer interaction through social volunteering groups. Organizations can create new groups and volunteers can join existing groups to connect with other volunteers and register for upcoming events with their group.
